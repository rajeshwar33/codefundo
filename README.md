Flood MApp :

The Flood MApp could prove to be a very useful app during floods.It helps residents and property owners of an area to have a clear understanding of their flood vulnerability. Areas in the map were categorized into 4 different zones depending on their scope of vulnerability. Red zones are the lowest areas and will be affected by even minor storms/floods.  Orange zones are likely to be impacted by moderate storm events. Yellow zones are those which get flooded only during the unlikely event of opening of dams on reaching the upper limit or during unexpectedly heavy downpours. Green zones are the safest zones among the four zones and these zones can be the best place for accommodating the flood affected people as they rarely get to flooded.  These area-categorization corresponds to areas that residents have reported as being prone to flooding in the above tide and storm conditions, according to their previous flood/storm experiences and also from the database prepared during the government's previous flood-relief operations. 
The app also indicates the nearest flood relief centers, provisional stores, health centers,etc. located in their region.
The app also contains frequently asked questions (FAQs), that can clarify most of the doubts of the people ranging from the basic doubts like the local emergency contact number to doubts like current flood condition of the region.
Both maps and FAQs have to be regularly updated to access their recent form. Since we can't be guaranteed of proper network connection during storms and floods, the app also gives the option to download the maps and FAQs offline, well in advance .
